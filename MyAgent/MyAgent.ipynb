      "You are advising a newly formed, technologically-capable island city‑state of 100,000 people (temperate climate, 20% arable land, rivers supplying freshwater, coastal fisheries, moderate wind and solar potential) that has $2 billion of starting capital in purchasing‑power terms and no external political alliances. Produce a 10‑year strategic plan whose explicit objective is to maximize population well‑being (health, education, per‑capita consumption), resilience to climate shocks, economic self‑sufficiency, and technological capacity while preserving social equity and minimizing environmental damage. In your answer:\n",

      "2) Describe the main trade‑offs you considered and give three alternative high‑level strategies (e.g., rapid industrialization, sustainability‑first, knowledge‑economy focus) and the specific scenarios in which each alternative would outperform your main plan.  \n",
      "3) Provide probabilistic estimates with brief justifications for the most likely ranges after 10 years for: GDP per capita (real terms), national life expectancy, percentage of energy demand met by local renewables, and the Gini coefficient.  \n",
      "4) List the three largest epistemic uncertainties that could most change your recommendations; for each, propose a practical data collection effort or field experiment that would meaningfully reduce that uncertainty within 12 months.  \n",
      "5) Give a concise 2‑sentence executive summary of the plan and a one‑paragraph explanation of why it is robust.  \n",
      "6) End with a candid self‑critique: list the top five ways your plan could fail, how you would detect each failure early using measurable indicators, and concrete contingency steps to correct course.\n",
